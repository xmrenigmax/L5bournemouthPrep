# L5bournemouthPrep

this directory is my educated learning into different languages based on the software engineering career i want to pursue, this is proof of revision and to keep track of my skills for the next academic year

so far my only strengths are game engines like unreal engine, and coding languages like C or python or markup languages like css,html and javascript (With a bit of react), so this document is here to help boost my diveristy and specialise in certain elements of needs.

this was suggested by lecturer Gernot, (cool guy)
